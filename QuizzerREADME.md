## Running the Quizzer
To run the quizzer, first ensure that CPSC 236 TestBank - Sheet1.csv is in the same directory as FinalQuizzer1.ipynb.
Then to run the quizzer, open FinalQuizzer1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebooks. Run the first cell, and you will be prompted with a set of questions.
The first few questions will be identifying information about the user, then a question to determine the quiz length, and finally, the quiz questions.

Each question is answered individually. Then, once the participant has completed all the questions, a short summary output will be displayed, giving a breif overview of how the user performed. Additionally, the same summary along with complete quiz information will be outputed to a separate text file named using their id, first name, and last name. This file includes every quiz question, the options available, the user's answer, and the correct answer for that question.
