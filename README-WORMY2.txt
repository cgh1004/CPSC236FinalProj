======================== Wormy 2 README!! ========================

	Few things to know:

1. The controlling can be difficult due to the speed, however changing the speed made it feel slow and did  not help with control.

2. It is possible to move in such a way that makes it look like you just hit an invisible wall, however it is actually you "hitting yourself". 

	What was changed:

1. Colors to make things easier to read, and to make more sense.

2. Font (I prefer comic sans).

3. Addition of an obstacle.

4. Replaced the spinning title screen with an introduction title screen
